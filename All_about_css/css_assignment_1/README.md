## All about CSS

In this assignment, I created a dashed border,

And a h2 tag <h2>Hurray<span>!</span></h2> 

Then used css to change the color of the exclamation mark 

on hover.

I also had an unordered list with three list items, whereby 

the bullet points had a different color than then content of the 

list.

**To achieve this assignment , I used the following css selectors**


element selector<br>

class 

universal selectors

ids

combinator selectors

pseudo class selector

pseudo element selector

attribute selector
